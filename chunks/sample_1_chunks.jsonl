Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued, with signs of strengthening\nactivities more recently. Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in\n2024–25 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project,\nand strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4¾ percent on average,\nboosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing\nreforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will\nlikely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term. With lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in\n2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5½ percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses\nmoderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar’s LNG production expands massively,\nboth the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share\nof GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall. Banks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to\n20 percent and return on equity of 14½ percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. Since the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’ net short-term foreign liabilities,\nbanks’ non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average\nmaturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding. The sector-wide NPL ratio\nremained broadly unchanged at slightly below 4 percent and the provisioning coverage ratio is\nrelatively high at above 80 percent."}

Domestic downside risk stems mainly from further weaknesses in the real estate\nsector, although strong tourism and policy measures introduced in 2023 could mitigate the\nrisk. Over the medium and long term, supply in the global natural gas market is expected to\nexpand significantly, potentially putting downward pressure on prices. On the upside,\nsustained high hydrocarbon prices and accelerated NDS3 reforms would strengthen the\noutlook. However, if ambitious NDS3 initiatives lead to resource misallocation, both the public\nfinance and growth prospect would be affected. Executive Board Assessment2\nExecutive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed Qatar’s\ncontinued resilience to external shocks and its favorable medium-term outlook, driven by\nsignificant increases in LNG production and the reforms under the Third National\nDevelopment Strategy. Directors agreed that maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and\naccelerating reform efforts would further solidify macroeconomic stability and resilience to\nshocks while boosting prosperity. Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence and called for\naccelerating fiscal reforms. They recommended adopting a medium-term fiscal anchor to help\nensure intergenerational equity, and reiterated the need to accelerate revenue diversification,\nparticularly by introducing the value-added tax. Directors highlighted the importance of\nimproving spending efficiency and composition, particularly by enhancing public investment\nmanagement. They welcomed the ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions and adopt a\nfull-fledged medium-term fiscal framework with enhanced fiscal risk management. Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to maintain financial stability and deepen domestic\nfinancial markets, while encouraging them to consider undertaking a Financial Sector\nAssessment Program update. They welcomed the newly introduced risk-based supervision\nand recommended formalizing the financial safety net and continuing to adjust\nmacroprudential policies to mitigate potential macro-financial risks.

Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to\nlower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform\nmomentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Outlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The medium-\nterm outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and\nreform gains. Fiscal and external surpluses will likely remain but moderate. Qatar has so far\nbeen resilient to the regional conflict, with risks to the outlook being balanced overall. Qatar’s strong policy buffers can help mitigate the impact of adverse shocks. Fiscal policy: The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The\npositive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to\nintroduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending\nefficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient\nspending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term\nfiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will\nenhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency\nand risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy. Monetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country\nwell. Efforts to strengthen liquidity management are welcome and should be guided by the\nrecent IMF technical assistance. Continued diligence to safeguard financial stability and\nformalizing the financial safety net are critical. Promoting more stable domestic funding\nthrough market deepening initiatives would help reduce banks’ exposure to short-term\nforeign funding. Strong efforts to improve AML/CFT effectiveness should continue. Structural reforms: Successful NDS3 implementation requires proper reform prioritization\nand inter-agency coordination."}

Our empirical strategy broadly follows Espinoza et al. (2011) and Fouejieu et al (2018) with both a\nGCC panel estimate (and teasing out Qatar-specific effects) and a single-country time-series analysis for\nQatar. Generally, Qatar had stronger fiscal multipliers than its GCC peers, but the gains from capital\nexpenditure weakened when capital stock became relatively high. Results from cross-GCC panel\nregression suggest that for the GCC, the average long-run fiscal multiplier for capital expenditure (0.7) is\nstronger and more persistent than that for current expenditure (statistically insignificant), although the\ngrowth gains from the former emerge with a lag. The Qatar-specific long-term cumulative multiplier for\ncapital expenditure (based on the GCC panel regression and a country dummy for Qatar) is close to 1.5. When capital stock is relatively high, however, the capital spending multipliers for both Qatar and the GCC\nbecome insignificant. A further analysis confirms how growth gains from capital spending in Qatar waned when the\ninfrastructure investment cycle appeared to have matured (Box Figure 1-1). Using a single-county\napproach, time-varying fiscal multipliers from capital spending in Qatar are estimated on a 12-year rolling\nbasis.

Qatar currently has more semi-\nskilled expatriate workers than skilled or highly skilled ones (Text Figure 17). Analysis in the IMF’s\n2023 Article IV Staff Report for Qatar suggests that increasing the share of more skilled\nexpatriate workers can be a top contributor to growth. Intensified Kafala reform would further\nenhance expatriate labor market protection and flexibility. Speedy implementation of newly\nintroduced programs targeting higher-skilled expatriate labor (e.g., new visa schemes including\na five-year Mustaqel residence visa for foreign talent and entrepreneurs and a visa extension\nprogram for graduating students to find jobs in Qatar) would improve labor force skills. Strengthening the social safety net including the pension scheme would also help. The renewed\n4-year collaboration program with ILO can support the authorities’ progress. • Enhancing the nationals’ talent and employment in the private sector.

AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact (concluded)\nThe private sector has played an important role in shifting Qatar’s labor market toward a more\nfavorable position for AI adoption. Private sector employment has grown by around 27 percent over the\nlast decade, but the number of technicians and professionals—two job categories with high AI exposure and\ncomplementarity—has increased by over 90 percent, significantly enhancing the country's potential to\nbenefit from AI adoption. “Enabling clusters” identified in NDS3 are likely to harness AI-driven productivity gains. By matching\nthe occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with\nthe AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure\nand complementarity quadrant.

The authorities agreed with staff recommendation to\nfocus reforms on boosting human capital and innovation, enhancing the business environment,\nattracting FDI and promoting exports. They agreed that Qatar was well placed to leverage AI for\nproductivity gains, and highlighted Qatar’s comparative advantage in energy cost and reliability to\nattract data centers, around which an ecosystem could be built to enhance domestic value added.

E. Enhancing Data Adequacy\n35. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but gaps remain (Annex VII). The\nauthorities are fully committed to meeting the IMF standards under the Enhanced General Data\nDissemination System (e-GDDS). Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but gaps\nremain in the coverage and granularity of fiscal and external statistics, especially for the International\nInvestment Position (including QIA positions), FDI and portfolio investment. The strong emphasis on\ndata in NDS3 is encouraging, and the NPC is working to enhance inter-agency coordination for data\ncollection and dissemination. The IMF stands ready to support the authorities’ progress in data and\nstatistics through capacity building. Authorities’ Views\n36. The authorities welcomed the IMF’s initiative to strengthen data adequacy and agreed\nwith staff assessment. They noted that the establishment of the national statistics center under the\nNPC would enhance data collection and dissemination and expressed interest in collaborating with\nthe IMF, including through TA. The gaps in external sector statistics were well recognized, and the\nNPC stressed that strong efforts were underway to enhance FDI data, which is also important for\nmonitoring and assessing progress in NDS3 initiatives. STAFF APPRAISAL\n37. Qatar has a favorable economic outlook and continues to demonstrate resilience to\nexternal shocks. Recent indicators suggest that the post-World Cup growth normalization has\nbottomed out and the gradual rebound in economic activities is gaining momentum. The medium-\nterm outlook is more positive, driven by significant increases in LNG production and the anticipated\nbenefits from NDS3 implementation. By maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and\naccelerating reform efforts, Qatar can further solidify its resilience to shocks and prosperity. 38."}

The authorities’ commitment to sustain fiscal discipline can be supported by\naccelerated fiscal reforms. Adopting a PIH-based medium-term fiscal anchor can help ensure\nintergenerational equity and guide a countercyclical fiscal policy. Accelerating revenue\ndiversification including to introduce the VAT would enhance revenue resilience and reduce the tax\nrevenue gap. To support efficient NDS3 reform implementation and ensure fiscal sustainability, it is\nimportant to enhance spending efficiency through rationalizing the wage bill and gradually phasing\nout the remaining subsidies, and improve spending composition to facilitate the transition to private\nsector-led growth. Gradually aligning domestic energy prices with export ones could generate\nadditional revenue and support Qatar’s climate goals. The ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal\ninstitutions pave the way to adopt a full-fledged MTFF with enhanced fiscal risk management. 28 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND"}

Strong efforts to maintain financial stability and deepen domestic financial market\nshould continue. Maintaining diligent supervision is important especially for banks with weaker\nasset qualities. Formalizing the financial safety net would further enhance financial stability. The QCB\nshould continue to review its macroprudential policies and adjust as needed to mitigate potential\nmacro-financial risks. Guided by FSS3, efforts to develop domestic capital market should accelerate,\nwhich would also help banks reduce their reliance on public sector deposits and exposure to short-\nterm foreign funding. Qatar’s excellent efforts in fighting financial crimes should continue. 40. The exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. The QCB should continue to adjust\nits policy rates in line with the US Federal Reserve while improving its liquidity forecasting. Over\ntime, establishing a wider and more stable policy interest rate corridor, promoting a more active\ninterbank market, and allowing fully market-based bank lending interest rates would enhance\nmonetary policy transmission. Qatar’s external position in 2023 was assessed to be moderately\nstronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. 41. Qatar’s vision to build a more diversified and knowledge-based economy calls for\nenhancing human capital and boosting economic complexity. Attracting and retaining high-\nskilled expatriate workers, enhancing the nationals’ talent and employment in the private sector, and\nfurther benefiting from the female talent will enhance human capital.

Overview of Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy\nThis Annex provides a brief overview of the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), which sets\nthe priorities to build a knowledge-based and more sustainable economy. It stresses the state’s role as\nan enabler of private sector-led growth, based on a candid assessment of the limitations and\nchallenges associated with a state-driven growth model. 1. Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) aims for a transformation\ntoward a private sector-led, knowledge-based, and more sustainable economy (Annex Figure\n1-1). Issued in January 2024, NDS3 covers the last miles of Qatar’s National Vision (QNV) 2030. From\nNDS1 (2011-16), NDS2 (2018-22) to NDS3 (2024-30), Qatar’s diversification strategy has gradually\ntransitioned from a public sector-driven, infrastructure-focused approach, to one that empowers the\nprivate sector to build a more dynamic and innovative economy (Table 1). NDS3 aims to leverage\nQatar’s strengths built over the last decade, including large financial resources, enhanced human\ncapital, and high-quality infrastructure. The strategy lays out a systematic approach for economic\ntransformation, with ambitious targets set. 2. NDS3 highlights Qatar’s progress made since the launch of the Qatar National Vision\n2030. Substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and\ninstitutional development. In particular, Qatar has achieved solid economic growth during 2008–23\n(average 5½ percent), with the share of non-hydrocarbon economy rising by more than 10\npercentage points (ppts) to 63 ppts. Qatar’s education and health systems, labor market including\nfor expatriate workers, and government effectiveness have also witnessed significant improvements. 3. NDS3 also recognizes candidly the limitations and key challenges in Qatar’s\ndiversification journey. Qatar’s progress in economic diversification lags some other GCC\ncountries, especially in fiscal revenue and exports."}

Qatar’s education and health systems, labor market including for expatriate workers, and government effectiveness have also witnessed significant improvements. 3. NDS3 also recognizes candidly the limitations and key challenges in Qatar’s diversification journey. Qatar’s progress in economic diversification lags some other GCC countries, especially in fiscal revenue and exports. NDS3 acknowledges relatively low non-\nhydrocarbon output growth in recent years with declining labor productivity, its costly diversification\nmodel driven largely by public sector spending with implications for fiscal sustainability, and\nincentives that hinder private sector development, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Skilled and\nhighly skilled employment rose (including both nationals and expatriates) but the majority remains\nless skilled. NDS3 points out barriers to market entry and FDI, various regulatory impediments, an\nimmature innovation ecosystem, and insufficient human capital as key challenges for further\ntransformation. The global energy transition only compounds the need to accelerate economic\ndiversification. 4. NDS3 stresses that the state should become an “enabler” of more vibrant and\nsustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close\nremaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment. NDS3 highlights the\nneed to harmonize economic zones to help attract FDI, boost international trade including through\nadditional trade agreements with key target markets, and Public-Private partnership (PPP) to\nfacilitate private sector participation. It also identifies “diversification clusters” to build comparative\nadvantages, setting ambitious targets both at the sectoral level and on macroeconomic outcomes. 42 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND"}

A more sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework is envisaged,\nsupported by diversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030\ntargets include to reach a fiscal surplus of 5½ percent of GDP (the past five-year-average was\n3 percent), maintain the current sovereign credit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and\nachieve manageable expenditure growth (below the non-hydrocarbon output growth rate). The\ngovernment plans to reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting,\nand enhance debt management through frameworks including sovereign green financing. • Human capital. The government will promote STEM education and upskill the Qataris. Initiatives to attract high-skilled expatriate workers will include labor immigration reforms,\nupskilling programs with private sector participation, and new visa schemes for elite talent and\nentrepreneurs. The goal is for skilled labor force to exceed 46 percent of the total by 2030\n(currently at 28 percent), with 20 percent of the Qatari workforce in the private sector (currently\nat 17 percent). • Inclusiveness. Qatar aims at maintaining a high fertility rate (of 3 percent) and increase the\neconomic participation of people with disabilities (to 30 percent by 2030). The government will\nlaunch marriage and family support programs, enhance maternity leave, and promote financial\nliteracy. For vulnerable segments, initiatives include better identification, skill development, and\nexpanded social services. Women's empowerment and volunteerism (targeting a 10 percent\nvolunteer rate) will also be key focuses. • Health. Qatar targets a life expectancy of above 82 years and a 36 percent reduction in non-\ncommunicable disease mortality by 2030. Key plans include healthcare infrastructure\noptimization, lifestyle programs, and advancing patient care. The government will enhance\nurban planning, cultural offerings, and public safety, aiming for fewer than 4.9 traffic deaths per\n100,000 population.

Qatar aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent\nrelative to the business-as-usual scenario by 2030 and expand renewable energy capacity to\n4 GW. The government will protect 30 percent of its land and marine areas, restore 30 percent of\ndegraded natural habitats and reduce groundwater extraction by 70 percent, with per-capita\nwater consumption below 310 liters per day. Plans include deploying carbon capture\ntechnologies, expanding biodiversity protection, improving water conservation, and fostering\ncircular economy practices. • Government efficiency. Qatar targets to rank in the top 10 percent on the Government\nEffectiveness Index, with 90 percent of services digitalized by 2030. High satisfaction rates are\nalso set to further reduce corruption and enhance satisfaction of public services.

External Sector Assessment\nOverall Assessment: Qatar’s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately\nstronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained\nrobust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In\n2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical\nlevels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to\nprogressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in\nthe pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current\naccount gap is expected to continue narrowing. Potential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged\nunder NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap. Fiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and\nspending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the\nexternal position in the medium term. Foreign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory\nBackground1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and\nlarge asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities\nside, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but\nrose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more.

On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are\nestimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023—they will continue to be supported by the\nprojected current account surpluses over the medium term.

The current account surplus fell from a decade high in 2022, by nearly 10 percentage points of\nGDP to 17 percent of GDP in 2023. Hydrocarbon prices normalized and in late-2023 hydrocarbon export\nvolume declined amid the regional conflict. Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance\noutflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus\nremained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and\nimports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong. The current account surplus is\nthus expected to abate somewhat to 16½ percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at around 15½ percent of\nGDP in the medium-term buoyed by the LNG production expansion in the North Field and relatively high,\nalbeit gradually falling, hydrocarbon prices. 46 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND"}

A nowcasting model for Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon economy is developed, based on\nprevious IMF work (Barhoumi, Karim, et al. 2022, Akbal, Faruk, et al. 2023), following the steps\nbelow:\n• Select predictive variables.

By identifying the\nkey drivers, we can refine and iterate on the model to improve accuracy and reliability over time. Figure III. 2. Qatar: Project Overview\nSource: IMF staff. 3. A few innovations have been introduced to Qatar’s nowcasting framework to optimize\nthe variable and model selections:\n• A big data approach in variable selection is developed to enhance the coverage of potential\npredictors of economic growth and reduces the lag between real-world events and nowcasts. Unlike traditional methods that select variables based on specific economic theories, this\napproach collects a large number of variables including those that are unconventional in\neconomic analysis, and evaluates their correlations with Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP. Specifically, a Stata program is developed to scrape the Haver and CEIC databases, identifying\nrelevant keywords in millions of data series. The keywords target data specific to Qatar and its\nkey trading partners. The program chooses 1,300 Qatar-specific series and 1,200 series related\nto Qatar’s trading partners for further selection. For the 2,500 variables, pairwise correlations are\nrun against Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP. Those with the highest correlations (both positive\nand negative) are kept. Judgement based on economic theories and knowledge of the Qatari\neconomy is then applied to ensure balanced sectoral coverage, narrowing the final pool to\n13 variables. Further refinements of variable selection can be done by conducting Shapley\ndecomposition of nowcasting results to identify contributions from different predicative\nvariables and iterate with alternative variables. • Machine learning (ML) models are applied to handle large and complex datasets. Unlike\ntraditional methods such as statistical models and surveys, ML models allow for better\nintegration of complex, non-linear relationships between economic variables that ARIMA models\nmight miss due to their linear structure and reliance on smaller, time-series data."}

Economic Developments and Outlook\nUnderpinned by its long-term strategic diversification plan “the Qatar National Vision 2030”, the Qatar economic\ntransformation is thriving, and substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and\ninstitutional development. After a very strong economic performance in 2022, boosted by the successful hosting of\nthe 2022 FIFA World Cup, output growth has normalized in 2023 and 2024, with recent signs of economic activities\nstrengthening at the end of 2024, notably in the tourism sector. Qatar's inflation has been generally declining\nthroughout 2023 and 2024. The medium-term outlook is positive, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion\nand by reform efforts which are expected to intensify under the upcoming Third National Development Strategy as\nwell as under the Third Financial Sector Strategy (3FSS) which is also expected to provide impetus for a sustainable\ngrowth. Qatar’s strong fundamentals and significant policy buffers would help mitigate any negative impact in case\ndownside risks materialize. Fiscal Policy\nThe State of Qatar’s low public debt, significant fiscal and external buffers, and the longer-term benefits and returns\nof the authorities’ investment plans for future generation are remarkable. The authorities continue to be fully\ncommitted to a prudent fiscal policy that aim to optimize the use of Qatar’s resources by improving spending\nefficiency and mobilizing non-oil revenues, all whilst promoting sustainable growth and preserving\nintergenerational equity. The 2024 budget was focused on allocating resources for the third National Development\nStrategy (NDS3) and supporting efforts to diversify the economy."}

The 2024 budget was focused on allocating resources for the third National Development Strategy (NDS3) and supporting efforts to diversify the economy. The general budget continues to focus on\nachieving the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030 related to the development of human capital by focusing on the\nhealth and education sectors – with the allocations for the two sectors constituting 20% of the total budget - in\naddition to the goals related to diversifying the local economy and enhancing its competitiveness. The authorities are committed to a sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework supported by\ndiversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 targets include to reach a fiscal\nsurplus of 5½ percent of GDP (way above the past five-year-average of 3 percent), maintain the current sovereign\ncredit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and achieve manageable expenditure growth. The government plans\nto reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, and enhance debt management through\nframeworks including sovereign green financing. The authorities intend to continue addressing underlying spending\ninefficiencies and diversify fiscal revenues notably through implementing the corporate income tax Pillar II in line\nwith the global timeline. The 2025 budget envisages broadly prudent spending plans and aims for a medium-term\nexpenditure-based fiscal consolidation. The authorities have made good progress in expanding program-based\nbudgeting to eventually cover all sectors by the end of 2025 and expect that the ongoing expenditure review would\ngenerate savings in the medium term.

The authorities agree with staff’s\nassessment that the exchange rate peg continues to serve the Qatari economy well. They appreciated the IMF\ntechnical Assistance on liquidity management and plan to progressively implement its recommendations. The QCB\naims to further improve the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework as a medium-term objective. Qatar’s banking sector is healthy, with strong capital buffers, sound liquidity and stable profitability. Furthermore,\nQCB maintains a robust regulatory framework and conducts effective supervision to ensure the health of the sector\nand to preempt any potential risks to financial stability. The QCB is committed to regular risk reassessment and the\nnewly introduced risk-based supervision strengthened the assessment of emerging risks and early action. Banks are\nwell prepared to manage legacy real estate sector weaknesses and the recent macroprudential measures were\neffectively implemented to address potential risks. The micro and macroprudential measures, including the counter-\ncyclical capital buffer, are periodically reviewed, and would be dynamically adjusted to manage emerging risks. Moving forward, developments in Qatar’s financial sector will be further supported by the Third Financial Sector\nStrategy (3FSS) covering the period 2023-2030. The strategy will be focusing on governance and regulatory\noversight; Islamic finance; digital innovation and advanced technologies; ESG and sustainability; and talent and\ncapabilities, with the aim to create vibrant financial and capital markets that lead the region in innovation, efficiency,\nand investor protection. “Based on a four-pillar approach - banking, insurance, digital finance, and capital markets\n- the Strategy provides a roadmap for the financial sector in Qatar to unlock its full potential in line with Qatar\nNational Vision (QNV) 2030."}

Qatar has made excellent progress in fighting financial crimes, as acknowledged by the 2023 AML/CFT mutual\nevaluation report by FATF which highlighted the strength in preventing financial crimes and law enforcement\nthrough improved risk assessment capacity and clearer policy priorities. The QCB has also banned financial\ninstitutions to use crypto assets. The authorities remain firmly committed to strengthening the AML/CFT framework\nin alignment with global standards, with a focus on risk-based supervision and effective enforcement to uphold\nfinancial integrity and resilience. Structural Reforms\nThe Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) 2024-2030 marks the final phase of the Qatar National Vision\n2030. Since launching the National Vision in 2008, Qatar has made significant strides by leveraging energy sector\nrevenues to build world-class infrastructure and institutions. As a result, Qatar’s nonhydrocarbon economy has\ngrown to account for about two-thirds of the total output, which underscores Qatar’s commitment to long-term\neconomic diversification. The NDS3, launched in January 2024, aims to achieve sustainable economic growth, establish a sustainable\nmedium-term general budget framework with healthy levels of debt, provide a high standard of living to Qataris\nand position Qatar as a global destination.

AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact1 Qatar has been actively preparing for embracing AI. In 2019, Qatar released its first National AI Strategy, focusing on education, data access, employment, business, research, and ethics. The AI Committee, established in 2021, coordinates efforts from ministries, universities, and financial institutions. A $2.5 billion AI investment package was announced in May 2024. AI-related research has also surged. Overall, Qatar is close to AEs in its AI readiness (text chart).  Increasing AI adoption in Qatar is expected to bring more benefits than risks to the labor market. Currently, about 37 percent of the labor force in Qatar is exposed to AI (18 ppts increase over a decade), comparable to the EM average but lower than the AE average (58 percent). Building on IMF (2023)2 staff analysis suggests that about 75 percent of the high AI exposure jobs in Qatar have high “complementarity”—workers in those jobs are more likely to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains than being replaced.

AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact (concluded) The private sector has played an important role in shifting Qatar’s labor market toward a more favorable position for AI adoption. Private sector employment has grown by around 27 percent over the last decade, but the number of technicians and professionals—two job categories with high AI exposure and complementarity—has increased by over 90 percent, significantly enhancing the country's potential to benefit from AI adoption. “Enabling clusters” identified in NDS3 are likely to harness AI-driven productivity gains. By matching the occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with the AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure and complementarity quadrant. On the other hand, the “growth clusters” identified in NDS3—manufacturing, logistics, and tourism—tend to have more limited AI exposure.  Scenario analysis points to potential gains in labor productivity from AI penetration in Qatar. Staff analysis suggests that, under an optimistic scenario where successful reforms to enhance human capital, innovation and private sector growth allow a more rapid increase in the share of jobs exposed to AI and faster AI adoption (than under the baseline), labor productivity growth could be lifted by an average of 1 ppt annually (above the baseline) over the medium term.

Tourism remained robust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In 2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical levels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to progressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in the pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current account gap is expected to continue narrowing. Potential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged under NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap. Fiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and spending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the external position in the medium term."}

On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are estimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023—they will continue to be supported by the projected current account surpluses over the medium term.

Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance outflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus remained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and imports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong. The current account surplus is thus expected to abate somewhat to 16½ percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at around 15½ percent of GDP in the medium-term buoyed by the LNG production expansion in the North Field and relatively high, albeit gradually falling, hydrocarbon prices."}

The REER regression model, which suggests a negative CA gap (–4.7 percent of GDP), was deemed less suitable for Qatar given its currency peg. Qatar’s significant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment methodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume volatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts (0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively).

Slower global growth would also weigh on domestic growth, affecting banking sector asset quality. Global financial market corrections may lead to capital outflows and increase financial stability risks, including due to banks’ still sizeable exposure to foreign funding.; 2: Qatar has fiscal space to respond to a major growth slowdown.

Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance but with shortcomings. Data frequency, timeliness and coverage should be improved. National accounts. Data sources used to compile quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices need to be broadened to enhance accuracy. GDP by expenditure needs to be more up to date–by component annual data lag the headline (in current prices) or are available only up to 2018 (in constant prices). For the latter, the quarterly data should also provide a breakdown (only the headline number is produced). Timeliness was an issue also for GDP by activity data (2023Q4 GDP data were released in early-September 2024. 2024Q1–Q2 GDP data were released in early-December 2024 and 2024Q3 GDP data at end-December 2024).

An IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission in 2019 supported transition to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Transparency was enhanced by the publication of annual budget documents and quarterly budget performance reports for the central government with headline budget and debt numbers––the reports could include more line items and quarterly debt numbers. The prospectus for sovereign euro bond issuance includes detailed information on revenue and expenditure line items, and external bonds, but publication is infrequent. For the 2023 budget, a press release was published and, instead of the regular budget statement, the Minister provided relevant information at the press conference. The format of the 2024 budget statement was similar to the 2023 budget press release. The coverage of financial operations should be broadened to the general government including the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).  External sector. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) reports quarterly balance of payments data timely, following the fifth edition of the balance of payments manual (BPM5). The financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Stock Exchange. However, financial account data are aggregated. The authorities need to improve coordination to enhance the coverage of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flow data (which deviate significantly from FDI commitment data). A 2017 TA mission helped develop a quarterly survey for nonfinancial sector data aimed at producing a quarterly International Investment Position (IIP) statement. However, following the TA the authorities have continued to face capacity constraints in providing comprehensive IIP data to the IMF. More work is needed to ensure comprehensive data coverage, collection, and granularity—efforts should strengthen to allow Qatar's participation in key surveys like the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).
