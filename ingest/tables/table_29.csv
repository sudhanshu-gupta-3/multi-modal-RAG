"Overall Assessment: Qatar’s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained robust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In 2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical levels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to progressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in the pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current account gap is expected to continue narrowing. Potential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged under NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap. Fiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and spending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the external position in the medium term."
Foreign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory
"Background1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and large asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities side, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but rose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more. Central bank reserves stood at US$53.8 billion in November 2024, up US$2 billion from 2023.  Assessment. On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are estimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023—they will continue to be supported by the projected current account surpluses over the medium term. On the liabilities side, a moderate level of external public debt contributes to strong overall fiscal debt sustainability (Annex IV. Fiscal and Debt Sustainability Assessment). Commercial banks’ external liability remained broadly unchanged, leaving the net foreign liability relatively large."

Current Account
"Background. The current account surplus fell from a decade high in 2022, by nearly 10 percentage points of GDP to 17 percent of GDP in 2023. Hydrocarbon prices normalized and in late-2023 hydrocarbon export volume declined amid the regional conflict. Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance outflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus remained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and imports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong. The current account surplus is thus expected to abate somewhat to 16½ percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at around 15½ percent of GDP in the medium-term buoyed by the LNG production expansion in the North Field and relatively high, albeit gradually falling, hydrocarbon prices."
