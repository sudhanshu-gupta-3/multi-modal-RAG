"Assessment. A lack of detailed information on the nature of financial flows complicates the analysis of Qatar’s financial account. The strong foreign asset position, including the QIA’s estimated sizable assets, limits risks and vulnerabilities related to capital flows. Declines in commercial banks’ foreign liabilities have reduced financial stability risks.",

"Background. The large current account surplus only Central Bank Foreign Reserves(Percent of IMF ARA metric)translated into a moderate increase in central bank 100foreign reserves in 2023, by US$4 billion to reach US$51.5 billion, equivalent to 24 percent of GDP, 807.8 months of prospective imports, 196 percent of short-term external debt, and an estimated 6059 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric (ARA, up from 52 percent in 2022)2. Much of the 40current account surplus was estimated to have been invested by the QIA overseas. In 2024H1, foreign 20reserve accumulation ($1 billion) remained more 0modest than implied by the size of the current 121416182022account surplus (US$20 billion).  Assessment. Qatar’s “overall” FX reserve coverage was adequate in 2023. QCB foreign reserves are complemented by large foreign assets held by the QIA, estimated at 220 percent of GDP in 2023. Together, they account for about 600 percent of the ARA metric, significantly above the 100 percent adequacy benchmark. _____________________________________________________________________________ 1The authorities face capacity constraints to provide comprehensive IIP data. 2The ARA is a composite metric that measures the adequacy of precautionary reserves. It is based on the relative risk weights for each source of foreign exchange drain drawing on the 10th percentile of observed outflows from emerging market economies during exchange market pressure episodes. Reserves in the range of 100–150 percent of the composite metric are considered broadly adequate for precautionary purposes.",
