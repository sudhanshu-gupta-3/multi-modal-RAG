Table VII. 1. Qatar: Data Adequacy Assessment for Surveillance,,,,,,,,,
"Rationale for staff assessment. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance but with shortcomings. Data frequency, timeliness and coverage should be improved. National accounts. Data sources used to compile quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices need to be broadened to enhance accuracy. GDP by expenditure needs to be more up to date–by component annual data lag the headline (in current prices) or are available only up to 2018 (in constant prices). For the latter, the quarterly data should also provide a breakdown (only the headline number is produced). Timeliness was an issue also for GDP by activity data (2023Q4 GDP data were released in early-September 2024. 2024Q1–Q2 GDP data were released in early-December 2024 and 2024Q3 GDP data at end-December 2024).  Prices. Monthly Consumer and Producer Price Indices (CPI, PPI), and real estate price data are published timely. CPI weights need to be updated more frequently. The Ministry of Justice publishes Weekly Newsletter with daily property transaction data by type which can benefit from greater consistency to better inform surveillance.  Government finance. The authorities are implementing the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) which enables compilation of accrual fiscal accounts. An IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission in 2019 supported transition to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Transparency was enhanced by the publication of annual budget documents and quarterly budget performance reports for the central government with headline budget and debt numbers––the reports could include more line items and quarterly debt numbers. The prospectus for sovereign euro bond issuance includes detailed information on revenue and expenditure line items, and external bonds, but publication is infrequent. For the 2023 budget, a press release was published and, instead of the regular budget statement, the Minister provided relevant information at the press conference. The format of the 2024 budget statement was similar to the 2023 budget press release. The coverage of financial operations should be broadened to the general government including the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).  External sector. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) reports quarterly balance of payments data timely, following the fifth edition of the balance of payments manual (BPM5). The financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Stock Exchange. However, financial account data are aggregated. The authorities need to improve coordination to enhance the coverage of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flow data (which deviate significantly from FDI commitment data). A 2017 TA mission helped develop a quarterly survey for nonfinancial sector data aimed at producing a quarterly International Investment Position (IIP) statement. However, following the TA the authorities have continued to face capacity constraints in providing comprehensive IIP data to the IMF. More work is needed to ensure comprehensive data coverage, collection, and granularity—efforts should strengthen to allow Qatar's participation in key surveys like the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).  Monetary and financial sectors. The QCB submits the monetary and financial statistics (MFS) for the central bank and other depository corporations based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The MFS data are published in the International Financial Statistics on a timely basis. Qatar also reports data on some key series and indicators of the Financial Access Survey (FAS), including mobile money and the two indicators of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, but does not report data by gender. The QCB reports the Financial Soundness Indicators as part of the National Summary Data Page, but does not submit to the IMF, and 4 indicators are missing relative to the IMF’s list of Core Financial Soundness indicators.",Data Adequacy Assessment Rating 1/,,,,,,,,

"Changes since the last Article IV consultation. The Planning and Statics Authority was replaced by a newly established National Planning Council to strengthen reform implementation stipulated in the Third National Development Strategy, including to improve statistics. The statistics authority is in the process of producing new supply and use tables to improve the consistency of GDP estimates. A household survey is being finalized, which will be used to update CPI weights. The domestic “FDI ecosystem” has been fully mapped to identify additional sources of input data including business registration platforms (i.e., QFC, QSTP, QFZA, Media city) which will increase survey frame from current 130+ entities to 2000+ entities.",,,,,,,,,
"Corrective actions and capacity development priorities. Enhance awareness across government entities of the data gaps and international best practices. Implement recommendations made by the above-mentioned TAs. Encourage the authorities to seek the Institute for Capacity Development (ICD) training, additional Statistics Departments (STA) TAs, and participate in the workshop on the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) to be organized by the newly established Riyadh Regional Office. Urge the National Planning Council and National Statistics Center to coordinate efforts across relevant government entities on statistics including consolidation of scattered data, submission to the IMF, and broader publication.",,,,,,,,,
"Use of data and/or estimates different from official statistics in the Article IV consultation. IIP data are unavailable, including QIA’s assets under management. Staff rely on different data sources as needed––it estimates external debt data (for non-bank private sector and public sector debt outside of the central government), uses alternative data sources for FDI, and relies on commercially available bank-level data.",,,,,,,,,
"Other data gaps. A more granular forward-looking calendar of key data releases would aid surveillance and enhance transparency. By maturity assets and liabilities data and by sector non-performing loans (NPLs) data will enhance the assessment of banking sector risks for surveillance. Data on enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and on climate change adaptation and mitigation would help inform surveillance.",,,,,,,,,
