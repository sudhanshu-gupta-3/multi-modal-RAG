Projected Non-hydrocarbon Primary Deficits and PIH Benchmark 1/ (Percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP) 50PIH benchmark central estimate and one standard deviation range4030Projected non-hydrocarbon primary deficit201023242526272829 Source: IMF staff calculations. 1/ PIH benchmark is calculated to ensure constant real per-capita income. Long-term parameters: Inflation and non-hydrocarbon real output growth = 2 percent, population growth = 0.75 percent, natural gas production volume = constant after NF expansion in 2030, nominal hydrocarbon price growth = 2 percent, nominal returns on QIA assets and discount rate = both 4.75 percent. Standard deviation range is based on historical oil price performance to capture the sensitivity of the PIH estimates to oil price volatility, thus enhancing robustness of the estimates.",
