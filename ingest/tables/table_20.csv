"Box 2. AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact1 Qatar has been actively preparing for embracing AI. In 2019, Qatar released its first National AI Strategy, focusing on education, data access, employment, business, research, and ethics. The AI Committee, established in 2021, coordinates efforts from ministries, universities, and financial institutions. A $2.5 billion AI investment package was announced in May 2024. AI-related research has also surged. Overall, Qatar is close to AEs in its AI readiness (text chart).  Increasing AI adoption in Qatar is expected to bring more benefits than risks to the labor market. Currently, about 37 percent of the labor force in Qatar is exposed to AI (18 ppts increase over a decade), comparable to the EM average but lower than the AE average (58 percent). Building on IMF (2023)2 staff analysis suggests that about 75 percent of the high AI exposure jobs in Qatar have high “complementarity”—workers in those jobs are more likely to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains than being replaced. Qatar’s labor market opportunity-to-risk ratio from AI exposure is significantly higher than EM or AE averages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
