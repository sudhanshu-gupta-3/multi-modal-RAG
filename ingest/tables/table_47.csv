Global Risks,,
High,Medium,
"Deepening geoeconomic fragmentation. Broader conflicts, inward-oriented policies, and weakened international cooperation result in a less efficient configuration of trade and FDI, supply disruptions, protectionism, policy uncertainty, technological and payments systems fragmentation, rising shipping and input costs, financial instability, a fracturing of international monetary system, and lower growth.",Supply disruptions and higher input costs would accelerate inflation. Lower FDI and trade would dampen output growth and the pace of economic diversification. The fiscal and external accounts would benefit if the price of and demand for the nation’s natural gas strengthen.,"Accelerate fiscal and structural reforms to boost potential non-hydrocarbon output growth, economic diversification, and private investment. Provide targeted support to the most vulnerable against higher inflation. Maintain prudent financial sector policy to ensure financial stability."

"Cyberthreats. Cyberattacks on physical or digital infrastructure (including digital currency and crypto assets), technical failures, or misuse of AI technologies trigger financial and economic instability.","As the nation continues to enhance its global visibility and digitalization, cyberthreats have reportedly increased significantly. Cyberattacks would, for instance, lead to financial losses for individuals and businesses, the theft of sensitive information, and disruptions in key operations (businesses, transportation, or power).","Qatar has expanded its capacity to contain cyberthreats by creating the National Cybersecurity Agency in 2021. A National Cybersecurity Strategy 2024-30 has been launched in September 2024 to further enhance legislation, coordinate with the ICT sector, and strike a balance between ensuring cybersecurity and promoting innovation. Effective implementation of the strategy, and continued close monitoring and supervision including of the banking and payment systems are key."

"Climate change. Extreme climate events driven by rising temperatures cause loss of life, damage to infrastructure, food insecurity, supply disruptions, lower growth, and financial instability. A disorderly transition to net-zero emissions and regulatory uncertainty lead to stranded assets and low investment.","Qatar’s ecosystem is highly vulnerable to climate shocks. Climate stressors have a significant impact on water, temperature, and sea level. With limited water resources and increasing temperatures, adaptation costs are likely to increase rapidly. Extreme climate events in partner countries could affect Qatar. A disorderly energy transition could affect Qatar’s hydrocarbon revenue and hence the fiscal and external positions.","In line with Qatar National Vision 2030, continue working on various initiatives, including renewable energy, green building practices, sustainable transportation, and education and awareness campaigns. The Climate Change Action Plan identifies a number of mitigation and adaptation measures across various sectors (healthcare, biodiversity, water management and infrastructure) to ensure the implementation the National Environment and Climate Change Strategy and the achievement of key goals including 25 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030."

"Real estate market weakness. Property prices remain weak amid oversupply, negatively affecting the banking system and the broader economy.","Bank asset quality could weaken, and the construction sector would come under pressure, potentially dampening credit and non-hydrocarbon output growth. On the other hand, banks’ exposure to the real estate market is well provisioned. Policy measures were also introduced in 2023 to monitor and mitigate risks associated with the real estate market.","Leverage the ongoing effort to step up surveillance of the property sector. Monitor risks to the banking sector closely and recognize NPLs promptly. Maintain strong banking sector capital buffers, liquidity and provisioning to mitigate the impact. Formalize financial safety net. Qatar has fiscal space to help contain threat to macroeconomic and financial stability."

"Uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Third National Development Strategy. Risks are two sided. On the upside, implementation could be faster, more efficient, and better coordinated than expected. On the downside, insufficient coordination and implementation capacity could lead to resource misallocation and slower progress.",Faster-than-expected implementation would boost medium-term growth more than envisaged. Slower-than-expected implementation would result in weaker-than-envisaged output gains. Resource misallocation would also entail larger fiscal costs.,"Properly sequence reforms and enhance inter-agency coordination to ensure appropriate resource allocation and smooth implementation. Regularly monitor and assess progress relative to benchmarks, reassess risks, and recalibrate implementation plans as needed, leveraging the newly established National Planning Council."
