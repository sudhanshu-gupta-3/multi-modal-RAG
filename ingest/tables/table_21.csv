"1Box 2. AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact (concluded) The private sector has played an important role in shifting Qatar’s labor market toward a more favorable position for AI adoption. Private sector employment has grown by around 27 percent over the last decade, but the number of technicians and professionals—two job categories with high AI exposure and complementarity—has increased by over 90 percent, significantly enhancing the country's potential to benefit from AI adoption. “Enabling clusters” identified in NDS3 are likely to harness AI-driven productivity gains. By matching the occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with the AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure and complementarity quadrant. On the other hand, the “growth clusters” identified in NDS3—manufacturing, logistics, and tourism—tend to have more limited AI exposure.  Scenario analysis points to potential gains in labor productivity from AI penetration in Qatar. Staff analysis suggests that, under an optimistic scenario where successful reforms to enhance human capital, innovation and private sector growth allow a more rapid increase in the share of jobs exposed to AI and faster AI adoption (than under the baseline), labor productivity growth could be lifted by an average of 1 ppt annually (above the baseline) over the medium term.
