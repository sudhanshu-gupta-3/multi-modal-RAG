"Assessment. Staff assesses the 2023 external position to be moderately stronger than the level implied by fundamentals and desirable policies, based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) regression model that yields a positive CA gap of 2.0 percent of GDP (text table). The REER regression model, which suggests a negative CA gap (–4.7 percent of GDP), was deemed less suitable for Qatar given its currency peg. Qatar’s significant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment methodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume volatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts (0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively). As the current account surplus is projected to moderate further in 2024, the CA gap is expected to narrow, aligning the external position more with the level implied by fundamentals and desirable policies.

Real Exchange Rate,
"Background. The Riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar Effective Exchange Rates(2010 average = 100)at 3.64 since July 2001. Qatar’s nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) appreciated by 1 percent, similar to the US’s. 150NEER, QatarQatar’s real effective exchange rate (REER) weakened by REER, Qatar1401 percent in 2023 as the nation’s inflation was below its NEER, UStrading partners’. In 2024 through November, REER 130depreciated somewhat from the same period in 2023.   120Assessment. With large reliance on hydrocarbon exports 110priced in U.S. dollars and elastic supply of expatriate labor, the impact of REER performance on Qatar’s 100competitiveness is limited. Based on the estimated CA gap 1618202224of 2.0 and an elasticity of 0.3, staff assesses REER as undervalued by 5.6 percent. The EBA-lite REER model suggests an overvaluation of 13.6 percent.",
Capital and Financial Accounts: Flows and Policy Measures,
"Background. The capital and financial account weakened in 2023. The composition shifted notably. Net portfolio outflows rose by nearly 10 percentage points of GDP to 15 percent of GDP, driven by portfolio investments abroad (11 percent of GDP). In contrast, net other investment outflows declined by 16 percentage points to 1 percent of GDP. Overseas investment declined and net reduction in liabilities mostly by commercial banks following the introduction of QCB measures, moderated. In 2024Q2, net portfolio outflows abated while net incurrence of other investment liabilities resumed.",
