Source of Risk and Likelihood Expected Impact if Risk is Realized Policy Response,,
Global Risks,,
High,Medium,
"Intensification of regional conflict(s). Escalation or spread of the conflict in Gaza and Israel, Russia’s war in Ukraine, and/or other regional conflicts or terrorism disrupt trade (e.g., energy, food, tourism, supply chains), remittances, FDI and financial flows, and payment systems, and lead to refugee flows.","The impact would depend on the nature of the event. The shock could translate into higher global hydrocarbon prices, but there is also the risk of LNG export disruption—the overall impact on Qatar is highly uncertain. Intensification of regional conflict(s) could also weaken investor confidence and disrupt supply chain, tourism, and capital flows.",The policy response would depend on the nature of the shock. Qatar has fiscal space to respond to a negative shock. The central bank should provide adequate liquidity in the banking system if needed. Continue to closely monitor financial institutions.

"Commodity price volatility. Supply and demand fluctuations (e.g., due to conflicts, export restrictions, OPEC+ decisions, and green transition) cause recurrent commodity price volatility, external and fiscal pressures and food insecurity in EMDEs, cross-border spillovers, and social and economic instability.","Qatar’s ongoing LNG production expansion will raise the economy’s sensitivity to energy price volatility. Higher-than-projected energy prices could strengthen fiscal and external positions, and non-hydrocarbon output growth as ample hydrocarbon liquidity and positive private sector confidence could boost consumption and investment. Pressures to increase public spending could rise. Lower oil prices would weaken the external and fiscal balances, and growth.",The authorities should implement a medium-term fiscal framework which helps insulate public spending from oil price volatility. Diversifying the revenue base toward more non-hydrocarbon sources would reduce revenue sensitivity to energy price volatility. Accelerate structural reforms to advance economic diversification.

"Global growth downside surprise. Growth slowdown in major economies, including due to supply disruptions, tight monetary policy, rising corporate bankruptcies, or a deeper-than-envisaged real estate sector contraction, with adverse spillovers through trade and financial channels, triggering sudden stops in some EMDEs. (Low probability is assigned to surprise acceleration in global growth).","Lower external demand reduces hydrocarbon export prices, weakening fiscal and external positions which are currently strong. Slower global growth would also weigh on domestic growth, affecting banking sector asset quality. Global financial market corrections may lead to capital outflows and increase financial stability risks, including due to banks’ still sizeable exposure to foreign funding.",Qatar has fiscal space to respond to a major growth slowdown. Fiscal policy should be anchored in a medium-term framework to reduce the risk of procyclicality. Continue to closely monitor banking sector developments to maintain financial stability. Accelerate structural reforms to boost economic diversification and non-hydrocarbon potential output.
Medium,Low,
"Monetary policy calibration. Amid elevated uncertainty and data surprises, monetary policy stances in major countries turn out to be too loose, hindering disinflation, or too tight for too long than warranted, stifling growth domestically and globally, and increasing capital flow and exchange rate volatility in EMDEs.","Consistent with the exchange rate peg, monetary policy in Qatar would closely follow that of the U.S. As domestic inflationary pressure remains low and growth continues to normalize from the World Cup-driven boom, the risk that a too loose monetary stance could de-anchor inflation expectations is limited. On the other hand, a monetary stance too tight for too long than warranted could negatively affect demand, but the ongoing public investment and spillovers from the North Field LNG expansion will support growth.","Maintain monetary policy and liquidity management that are consistent with the currency peg. Continue to closely monitor banking sector developments to ensure financial stability. If growth is negatively affected by unduly tight (imported) monetary policy stance, some fiscal space could be deployed to provide targeted support while maintaining broad fiscal prudence."

"Systemic financial instability. High interest rates and risk premia, and sudden asset repricing amid economic slowdowns and policy uncertainty (including from elections) trigger market dislocations, with cross-border spillovers and an adverse macro-financial feedback loop putting weak banks and NBFIs under pressure.","Tighter global financial conditions would increase debt service and financing costs, and increase the liquidity risk for domestic banks reliant on foreign funding as banks’ net foreign liabilities remain relatively high. Such risks are however mitigated by Qatar’s large financial buffers, favorable market access, high sovereign credit ratings, and banks’ reduced exposure to nonresident deposits.","Maintain prudent financial sector policy and closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities related to financial institutions, including through stress tests and thematic inspections. Provide liquidity to the financial system if needed, compatible with the currency peg."
