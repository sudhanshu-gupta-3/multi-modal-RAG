Fiscal Policy,
The medium-term fiscal strategy should balance sustained fiscal prudence and transformation to a private sector-led economy.,"Broad fiscal prudence has been maintained and is expected to be upheld. The authorities plan to align spending with reform priorities in line with NDS3, including towards building climate resilience and human capital."
"Accelerate revenue diversification, including via VAT introduction and CIT broadening.","Recognizing the importance of mobilizing non-hydrocarbon revenues, the authorities preferred to introduce the VAT and other revenue diversification measures when domestic/global growth are more robust. Preparation for the implementation of the global minimum CIT is underway—its introduction is expected to be at the beginning of 2025."
Rationalize wage bill and continue subsidy reforms.,"Efforts are ongoing to introduce program-based budgeting, and the expenditure review program to enhance efficiency is underway."
Establish a well-designed medium-term fiscal framework and enhance transparency.,Qatar’s updated medium-term budget covers a 5-year period for the first time to support NDS3 implementation.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policy,
Strengthen liquidity forecasting and management.,The QCB has continued to improve liquidity management through T-bill issuance. A recent IMF technical assistance provided a series of recommendations which the QCB is considering.
Contain banks' exposure to foreign liabilities.,"A series of QCB measures have helped reduce banks’ short-term foreign asset-liability mismatches. A comprehensive Third Financial Sector Strategy was published, with plans to deepen domestic financial market which would help boost banks’ domestic funding."
Continue strengthening efforts to enhance banking sector resilience.,"Financial safety net (deposit insurance, recover/resolution framework) is being enhanced with IMF technical assistance. Measures to limit risks from the real estate sector have been introduced."
Carefully balance opportunities and risks around fintech and green financing initiatives with adequate regulations.,A number of related areas are articulated in the Third Financial Sector Strategy. Fintech sandboxes provide a controlled environment. The digital asset framework establishes a legal and regulatory foundation.
Implement the FATF action plan in a decisive and coordinated manner.,The authorities have submitted an action plan to implement FATF recommendations. A recent IMF diagnostic mission identified TA needs and initiated a 2-year work program to strengthen the effectiveness of the AML/CFT framework.
Structural Reforms and Statistics,
"Focus further reforms on productivity, business environment, digitalization, and climate actions.","Reforms are being intensified guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) released in January 2024, which provides an ambitious reform agenda to enhance human capital, productivity, business environment, and climate resilience."
"Enhance macroeconomic statistics by improving data quality, coverage, and timeliness, and by strengthening the institutional framework for statistics.","The National Planning Council (NPC) took over the former Planning and Statistics Authority (PSA) in May 2024. The National Statistics Center is established under NPC to strengthen statistics. Comprehensive data coverage on the external financial account and the International Investment Position remains a challenge, highlighted by Qatar's absence from surveys on CPIS and CDIS."
